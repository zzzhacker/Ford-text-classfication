## In this repositery we are building a simple text classcification model with Naive Bayes from scratch and also writing a blog to understand the concepts behind the Naive Bayes.

- We are using the [Ford Sentence Classifiaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaveshjain/ford-sentence-classifiaction-dataset) from Kaggle.
- We will understand which Bayes Theorem and Naive Bayes assumptions.
- We will perform experiment with Laplace smoothing, Removal of Less Frequent words, Stop words removal etc to better understand their effects.
